Nervos CKB developers are working on a growing number of tools to help developers build, test, and deploy their applications. We have launched the **[Aggron Testnet](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/wiki/Chains)** and welcome developers to provide passion, innovation and diversity of ideas to upgrade the development experience. In this section we will introduce our development tools.

1. Testnet Aggron
2. Dev chain 
3. ckb-cli
4. ckb-sdk
5. Testnet Faucet
6. CKB JSON-RPC Protocols

Before you start to play around with the testnet, here are some things you should notice:

* Aggron Testnet is only for development and test use.
* The tokens on this testnet have no value, so please be aware of scams.
* The testnet will be reset and updated depending on development status, so any tokens or state you have on the testnet will be cleared upon the testnet reset.
