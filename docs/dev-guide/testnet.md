We have launched Aggron Testnet for developers to test their integration and smart contracts in real environment.The Aggron Testnetâ€™s info has been published via Wiki:
[Chains](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/wiki/Chains) .Please refer it for more details. Because of the hash rate surge, Aggron will reset regularly.

### Run a CKB Testnet node

**System Requirements**

Any modern computer with macOS/Linux/Windows operating system should be able to run a CKB node and mining programs. Alternatively, you can also use [Docker](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/docs/run-ckb-with-docker.md) if your operating system is not properly supported by CKB for now.

To run a CKB node, please follow the instructions explained in detail below:

**Step 1: Download the latest ckb binary file from the CKB releases page on GitHub (https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases), then check if it works with:**

```
ckb --version 
ckb-cli --version
```

ckb-cli 0.31.0 (a531b3b 2020-04-17)
```
</details>

**Step 2: Connect to Aggron Testnet**

* Init CKB node with `ckb init --chain testnet`

```
ckb init --chain testnet
```

create ckb.toml
create ckb-miner.toml
```
</details>

**Step 3: Start the CKB Testnet node**

```
