title: Testnet Aggron
---

We are going to deploy a PoA (Proof of Authority) algorithm to create blocks in the testnet. However, it will take some time to develop. Before that we will reset the testnet regularily whenver there's no new blocks in an hour. 
The chain spec used to start Aggron has been published [here](https://gist.github.com/doitian/573513c345165c0fe4f3504ebc1c8f9f). Please refer to the [Chains](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/wiki/Chains) document for Aggron Testnetâ€™s info.

### Run a CKB Testnet node

**System Requirements**

Any modern computer with macOS/Linux/Windows operating system should be able to run a CKB node and mining programs. Alternatively, you can also use [Docker](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/docs/run-ckb-with-docker.md) if your operating system is not properly supported by CKB for now.

To run a CKB node, please follow the instructions explained in detail below:

**Step 1: Download the latest ckb binary file from the CKB releases page on GitHub (https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases), then check if it works with:**

```
ckb --version 
ckb-cli --version
```

```bash
ckb 0.25.2 (dda4ed9 2019-11-17)
ckb-cli 0.25.2 (6ca7bbb 2019-11-17)
```
</details>

**Step 2: Connect to Aggron Testnet**

* Create [aggron.toml](https://gist.github.com/doitian/573513c345165c0fe4f3504ebc1c8f9f/raw/3032bed68550e0a50e91df2c706481e80b579c70/aggron.toml) in the directory containing the CKB binary. 
* Init CKB node with `ckb init --import-spec ./aggron.toml --chain testnet`

cp ./aggron.toml specs/testnet.toml
create ckb.toml
create ckb-miner.toml
```
</details>

**Step 3: Start the CKB Testnet node**

```
ckb run
```
